## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge for the PING Coming Soon page.

This was taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) and challenges users to improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge was to replicate as close as possible to the above design encapsulating:

1. desktop version
2. mobile version (via media queries. Set at 375px)
3. ensure an appropriate "error" message appeared if an invalid email address was entered. This was achieved via a REGEXP.
4. Social media icons. Achieved from IonIcons using their <script></script> tag to their CDN.
